# Poems/Tweet Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks


This creative software can generate poems in the style of famous poets, tweets from famous people who were active on Twitter, or even WhatsApp messages based on the history of previous messages.
For the texts mentioned above to be generated, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and, in particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) are utilised. Even though the project is still in its infancy, it has already demonstrated its ability to generate interesting texts, showing meaningfulness, grammaticality, and poeticness (in the case of poem creation).
